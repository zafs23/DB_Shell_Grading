## Using onyx sandbox:
username: msandbox
password: b0is3cs410
port: 50763

To run JDBCConnect.java:
javac JDBCConnect.java
java JDBCConnect 50763 b0is3cs410 testdb
** testdb won't actually be our db name, but for now I've commented out all transactional code
so this is just to test connection through the java file.
