## OVERVIEW:
 
 This project implements a command shell application in java for managing grades in a 
 class. 


## INCLUDED FILES:

 * GradeManager.java - source file
 * DBShell.java - source file
 * JDBCConnect.java - source file
 * README - this file
 * E-R_Model.pdf - design file
 * schema.sql - Database Script
 * dump.sql - Example Data in MySQL dump file


## COMPILING AND RUNNING:
 
 To run the shell command first compile using the following command:

 $ javac DBShell.java
 
 After that to run the compiled class to test the output type the following command:
 
 $ java DBShell
 
 
 ## PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPORTANT CONCEPTS:
 
 The program design is implemented in the E-R model. Then the database schema is implemented using the schema.sql script. 
 
 ## TESTING:
 
 For testing example data has been used to mimic the shell properties. The video contains detailed step by step testing of the command shell. 
 
 
## DISCUSSION:
 To implement the queries the E-R model helped a lot. Some class notes are used as reference to implement complicated queries.
